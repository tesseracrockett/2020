knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Sept. 23, 2020

*Goal:* Plot number of specimens by age.

*Worked:*
```{r}
ant_data <-  read_csv("wright/data/FossilAnts.csv")
sepped <- ant_data %>%
  separate(min_mx, c("min_age", "max_age"), "_")

ggplot(sepped) + geom_bar(aes(y = min_age))
```



*Did Not Work:* 

* Must not name `min` or `max` because R will think you're calling `min()` and `max()` functions
* Can't make a barplot from group_by       


## October 5

Trying revision management for the first time.


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
