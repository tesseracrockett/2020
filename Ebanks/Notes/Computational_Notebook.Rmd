## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Trying revision management for the first time. 

-{x} First push worked

## Ppt Notes:
Adding code to a repository 
  - add -> commit -> push
    - Adding tells Git what file we've added stuff to 
    - Commit tells Git to save the file
      - "Commiting" to the work you've done
    - Push puts the code in the online repository

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
