*Goal:* Plot species capture numbers with certain trap types. 

*Worked:*
```
agp_traps <- agp %>% 
filter(TrapType != "Other") %>% 
filter(TrapType != "Hand") %>% 
filter(TrapType != "NA")

Worked to remove some values. 
```

*Did Not Work:*

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Trying revision management for the first time. 

Repository = a place for all the code of a project

Workflow: add - commit - push
When we have some code we wanna add to a repository we have three steps. 
Add = tell Git what file we've added stuff to
Commit = tell Git what code to save; "commiting" to code 
Push = actually put the code in the repository
