<p>We’re now all going to log in to the class <em>server</em>. A server is a remote computer - this enables us to do computing tasks without having to use up our own compute resources. It also enables me, as the professor, to control the user environment, and ensure everyone gets the same user experience.</p>
<p>Navigate to:</p>
<p><a href="http://class.selucompbio2019.org:8787/" class="uri">http://class.selucompbio2019.org:8787/</a></p>
<p>You will be prompted for a username and password. You username will be your first name, and your password will be selucomp.</p>
<p>What you see is the four-panel RStudio default. Let’s talk about each of these panels.</p>

<div id="getting-set-up" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#getting-set-up" class="anchor"></a>Getting set up</h2>
<p>It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text self-contained in a single folder, called the working directory. All of the scripts within this folder can then use relative paths to files that indicate where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to absolute paths, which point to where a file is on a specific computer). Working this way makes it a lot easier to move your project around on your computer and share it with others without worrying about whether or not the underlying scripts will still work.</p>
<p>RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its “Projects” interface, which not only creates a working directory for you, but also remembers its location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it) and optionally preserves custom settings and open files to make it easier to resume work after a break. Go through the steps for creating an “R Project” for this tutorial below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Under the File menu, click on New Project. Choose Version Control. Enter the following web address:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Paleantology/BiologicalDataAnalysis2019" class="uri">https://github.com/Paleantology/BiologicalDataAnalysis2019</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click on Create Project.</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) Set Preferences to ‘Never’ save workspace in RStudio.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>RStudio’s default preferences generally work well, but saving a workspace to .RData can be cumbersome, especially if you are working with larger datasets. To turn that off, go to Tools –&gt; ‘Global Options’ and select the ‘Never’ option for ‘Save workspace to .RData’ on exit.’</p>

<div id="organizing-your-working-directory" class="section level2">

<a href="#organizing-your-working-directory" class="anchor"></a>Organizing your working directory</h2>
<p>Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you may create directories (folders) for scripts, data, and documents.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>data/</em> Use this folder to store your raw data and intermediate datasets you may create for the need of a particular analysis. For the sake of transparency and provenance, you should always keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much of your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e., with scripts, rather than manually) as possible. Separating raw data from processed data is also a good idea. For example, you could have files data/raw/tree_survey.plot1.txt and …plot2.txt kept separate from a data/processed/tree.survey.csv file generated by the scripts/01.preprocess.tree_survey.R script.<br>
</li>
<li>
<em>documents/</em> This would be a place to keep outlines, drafts, and other text.</li>
<li>
<em>scripts/</em> This would be the location to keep your R scripts for different analyses or plotting, and potentially a separate folder for your functions (more on that later).</li>
</ul>
<p>You may want additional directories or subdirectories depending on your project needs, but these should form the backbone of your working directory.</p>
</div>
<div id="interacting-with-r" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#interacting-with-r" class="anchor"></a>Interacting with R</h2>
<p>In the lower left window, you should now see a file explorer. Open the <code>Vignettes</code> folder, and double click 01_Getting_Started_with_R.Rmd</p>
<p>The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the computer to follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those instructions. We write, or code, instructions in R because it is a common language that both the computer and we can understand. We call the instructions commands and we tell the computer to follow the instructions by executing (also called running) those commands.</p>
<p>There are two main ways of interacting with R: by using the console or by using script files (plain text files that contain your code). The console pane (in RStudio, the bottom left panel) is the place where commands written in the R language can be typed and executed immediately by the computer. It is also where the results will be shown for commands that have been executed. You can type commands directly into the console and press Enter to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten when you close the session.</p>
<p>Because we want our code and workflow to be reproducible, it is better to type the commands we want in the script editor, and save the script. This way, there is a complete record of what we did, and anyone (including our future selves!) can easily replicate the results on their computer.</p>
<p>RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using the Ctrl + Enter shortcut (on Macs, Cmd + Return will work, too). The command on the current line in the script (indicated by the cursor) or all of the commands in the currently selected text will be sent to the console and executed when you press Ctrl + Enter. You can find other keyboard shortcuts in this RStudio cheatsheet about the RStudio IDE.</p>
<p>At some point in your analysis you may want to check the content of a variable or the structure of an object, without necessarily keeping a record of it in your script. You can type these commands and execute them directly in the console. RStudio provides the Ctrl + 1 and Ctrl + 2 shortcuts allow you to jump between the script and the console panes.</p>
<p>If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a &gt; prompt. If it receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting or sent from the script editor using Ctrl + Enter), R will try to execute it, and when ready, will show the results and come back with a new &gt; prompt to wait for new commands.</p>
<p>If R is still waiting for you to enter more data because it isn’t complete yet, the console will show a + prompt. It means that you haven’t finished entering a complete command. This is because you have not ‘closed’ a parenthesis or quotation, i.e. you don’t have the same number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses, or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks. When this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command, click inside the console window and press Esc; this will cancel the incomplete command and return you to the &gt; prompt.</p>
<p>Let’s just try a simple command to make sure we’re all up and running:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">name</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="st">"April"</span>
<span class="no">name</span></pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] "April"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="creating-objects-in-r" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#creating-objects-in-r" class="anchor"></a>Creating objects in R</h1>
<p>You can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fl">3</span> + <span class="fl">5</span></pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fl">12</span> / <span class="fl">7</span></pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 1.714286</code></pre>
<p>However, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign <em>values</em> to <em>objects</em>. To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the assignment operator <code>&lt;-</code>, and the value we want to give it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">weight_kg</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fl">55</span></pre></body></html></div>
<p><code>&lt;-</code> is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the right to objects on the left. So, after executing <code>x &lt;- 3</code>, the value of <code>x</code> is <code>3</code>. The arrow can be read as 3 <strong>goes into</strong> <code>x</code>. For historical reasons, you can also use <code>=</code> for assignments, but not in every context. Because of the <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2008/12/use-equals-or-arrow-for-assignment.html">slight</a> <a href="http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Is-there-any-difference-between-and-tp878594p878598.html">differences</a> in syntax, it is good practice to always use <code>&lt;-</code> for assignments.</p>
<p>In RStudio, typing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> (push <kbd>Alt</kbd> at the same time as the <kbd>-</kbd> key) will write <code>&lt;-</code> in a single keystroke in a PC, while typing <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> (push <kbd>Option</kbd> at the same time as the <kbd>-</kbd> key) does the same in a Mac.</p>
<p>Objects can be given any name such as <code>x</code>, <code>current_temperature</code>, or <code>subject_id</code>. You want your object names to be explicit and not too long. They cannot start with a number (<code>2x</code> is not valid, but <code>x2</code> is). R is case sensitive (e.g., <code>weight_kg</code> is different from <code>Weight_kg</code>). There are some names that cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g., <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>for</code>, see <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html">here</a> for a complete list). In general, even if it’s allowed, it’s best to not use other function names (e.g., <code>c</code>, <code>T</code>, <code>mean</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>df</code>, <code>weights</code>). If in doubt, check the help to see if the name is already in use. It’s also best to avoid dots (<code>.</code>) within an object name as in <code>my.dataset</code>. There are many functions in R with dots in their names for historical reasons, but because dots have a special meaning in R (for methods) and other programming languages, it’s best to avoid them. It is also recommended to use nouns for object names, and verbs for function names. It’s important to be consistent in the styling of your code (where you put spaces, how you name objects, etc.). Using a consistent coding style makes your code clearer to read for your future self and your collaborators. In R, three popular style guides are <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml">Google’s</a>, <a href="http://jef.works/R-style-guide/">Jean Fan’s</a> and the <a href="http://style.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse’s</a>. The tidyverse’s is very comprehensive and may seem overwhelming at first. You can install the <a href="https://github.com/jimhester/lintr"><strong><code>lintr</code></strong></a> package to automatically check for issues in the styling of your code.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="objects-vs.-variables">Objects vs. variables</h3>
<p>What are known as <code>objects</code> in <code>R</code> are known as <code>variables</code> in many other programming languages. Depending on the context, <code>object</code> and <code>variable</code> can have drastically different meanings. However, in this lesson, the two words are used synonymously. For more information see: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Objects" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Objects</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">weight_kg</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fl">55</span>    <span class="co"># doesn't print anything</span>
(<span class="no">weight_kg</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fl">55</span>)  <span class="co"># but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`</span></pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 55</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">weight_kg</span>          <span class="co"># and so does typing the name of the object</span></pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 55</code></pre>
<p>Now that R has <code>weight_kg</code> in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fl">2.2</span> * <span class="no">weight_kg</span></pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 121</code></pre>
<p>We can also change an object’s value by assigning it a new one:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">weight_kg</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fl">57.5</span>
<span class="fl">2.2</span> * <span class="no">weight_kg</span></pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 126.5</code></pre>
<p>This means that assigning a value to one object does not change the values of other objects For example, let’s store the animal’s weight in pounds in a new object, <code>weight_lb</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">weight_lb</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fl">2.2</span> * <span class="no">weight_kg</span></pre></body></html></div>
<p>and then change <code>weight_kg</code> to 100.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">weight_kg</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fl">100</span></pre></body></html></div>
<p>What do you think is the current content of the object <code>weight_lb</code>? 126.5 or 220?</p>
<div id="comments" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#comments" class="anchor"></a>Comments</h3>
<p>The comment character in R is <code>#</code>, anything to the right of a <code>#</code> in a script will be ignored by R. It is useful to leave notes and explanations in your scripts. RStudio makes it easy to comment or uncomment a paragraph: after selecting the lines you want to comment, press at the same time on your keyboard <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>. If you only want to comment out one line, you can put the cursor at any location of that line (i.e. no need to select the whole line), then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.</p>
<blockquote>

<div id="functions-and-their-arguments" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#functions-and-their-arguments" class="anchor"></a>Functions and their arguments</h3>
<p>Functions are “canned scripts” that automate more complicated sets of commands including operations assignments, etc. Many functions are predefined, or can be made available by importing R <em>packages</em> (more on that later). A function usually takes one or more inputs called <em>arguments</em>. Functions often (but not always) return a <em>value</em>. A typical example would be the function <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/MathFun.html">sqrt()</a></code>. The input (the argument) must be a number, and the return value (in fact, the output) is the square root of that number. Executing a function (‘running it’) is called <em>calling</em> the function. An example of a function call is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">b</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/MathFun.html">sqrt</a></span>(<span class="no">a</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>Here, the value of <code>a</code> is given to the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/MathFun.html">sqrt()</a></code> function, the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/MathFun.html">sqrt()</a></code> function calculates the square root, and returns the value which is then assigned to the object <code>b</code>. This function is very simple, because it takes just one argument.</p>
<p>The return ‘value’ of a function need not be numerical (like that of <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/MathFun.html">sqrt()</a></code>), and it also does not need to be a single item: it can be a set of things, or even a dataset. We’ll see that when we read data files into R.</p>
<p>Arguments can be anything, not only numbers or filenames, but also other objects. Exactly what each argument means differs per function, and must be looked up in the documentation (see below). Some functions take arguments which may either be specified by the user, or, if left out, take on a <em>default</em> value: these are called <em>options</em>. Options are typically used to alter the way the function operates, such as whether it ignores ‘bad values’, or what symbol to use in a plot. However, if you want something specific, you can specify a value of your choice which will be used instead of the default.</p>
<p>Let’s try a function that can take multiple arguments: <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html">round()</a></code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html">round</a></span>(<span class="fl">3.14159</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>Here, we’ve called <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html">round()</a></code> with just one argument, <code>3.14159</code>, and it has returned the value <code>3</code>. That’s because the default is to round to the nearest whole number. If we want more digits we can see how to do that by getting information about the <code>round</code> function. We can use <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/args.html">args(round)</a></code> to find what arguments it takes, or look at the help for this function using <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html">?round</a></code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb23"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/args.html">args</a></span>(<span class="no">round</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## function (x, digits = 0) 
## NULL</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb25"><html><body><pre class="r">?<span class="no">round</span></pre></body></html></div>
<p>We see that if we want a different number of digits, we can type <code>digits = 2</code> or however many we want.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb26"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html">round</a></span>(<span class="fl">3.14159</span>, <span class="kw">digits</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="fl">2</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.14</code></pre>
<p>If you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you don’t have to name them:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb28"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html">round</a></span>(<span class="fl">3.14159</span>, <span class="fl">2</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.14</code></pre>
<p>And if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb30"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html">round</a></span>(<span class="kw">digits</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="fl">2</span>, <span class="kw">x</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="fl">3.14159</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 3.14</code></pre>
<p>It’s good practice to put the non-optional arguments (like the number you’re rounding) first in your function call, and to then specify the names of all optional arguments. If you don’t, someone reading your code might have to look up the definition of a function with unfamiliar arguments to understand what you’re doing.</p>

<div id="vectors-and-data-types" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#vectors-and-data-types" class="anchor"></a>Vectors and data types</h2>
<p>A vector is the most common and basic data type in R, and is pretty much the workhorse of R. A vector is composed by a series of values, which can be either numbers or characters. We can assign a series of values to a vector using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c()</a></code> function. For example we can create a vector of animal weights and assign it to a new object <code>weight_g</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb32"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">weight_g</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span>(<span class="fl">50</span>, <span class="fl">60</span>, <span class="fl">62.5</span>, <span class="fl">65</span>, <span class="fl">82</span>, <span class="fl">90</span>)
<span class="no">weight_g</span></pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 50.0 60.0 62.5 65.0 82.0 90.0</code></pre>
<p>A vector can also contain characters:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb34"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">animals</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span>(<span class="st">"mouse"</span>, <span class="st">"rat"</span>, <span class="st">"dog"</span>)
<span class="no">animals</span></pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] "mouse" "rat"   "dog"</code></pre>
<p>The quotes around “mouse”, “rat”, etc. are essential here. Without the quotes R will assume objects have been created called <code>mouse</code>, <code>rat</code> and <code>dog</code>. As these objects don’t exist in R’s memory, there will be an error message.</p>
<p>There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a vector. <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/length.html">length()</a></code> tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb36"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/length.html">length</a></span>(<span class="no">weight_g</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 6</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb38"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/length.html">length</a></span>(<span class="no">animals</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>An important feature of a vector, is that all of the elements are the same type of data. The function <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/class.html">class()</a></code> indicates the class (the type of element) of an object:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb40"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/class.html">class</a></span>(<span class="no">weight_g</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] "numeric"</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb42"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/class.html">class</a></span>(<span class="no">animals</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] "character"</code></pre>
<p>The function <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/str.html">str()</a></code> provides an overview of the structure of an object and its elements. It is a useful function when working with large and complex objects:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb44"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/str.html">str</a></span>(<span class="no">weight_g</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>##  num [1:6] 50 60 62.5 65 82 90</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb46"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/str.html">str</a></span>(<span class="no">animals</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>##  chr [1:3] "mouse" "rat" "dog"</code></pre>
<p>You can use the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c()</a></code> function to add other elements to your vector:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb48"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">weight_g</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span>(<span class="no">weight_g</span>, <span class="fl">90</span>) <span class="co"># add to the end of the vector</span>
<span class="no">weight_g</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span>(<span class="fl">30</span>, <span class="no">weight_g</span>) <span class="co"># add to the beginning of the vector</span>
<span class="no">weight_g</span></pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 30.0 50.0 60.0 62.5 65.0 82.0 90.0 90.0</code></pre>
<p>In the first line, we take the original vector <code>weight_g</code>, add the value <code>90</code> to the end of it, and save the result back into <code>weight_g</code>. Then we add the value <code>30</code> to the beginning, again saving the result back into <code>weight_g</code>.</p>
<p>We can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble a dataset. As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are collecting or calculating.</p>
<p>An <strong>atomic vector</strong> is the simplest R <strong>data type</strong> and is a linear vector of a single type. Above, we saw 2 of the 6 main <strong>atomic vector</strong> types that R uses: <code>"character"</code> and <code>"numeric"</code> (or <code>"double"</code>). These are the basic building blocks that all R objects are built from. The other 4 <strong>atomic vector</strong> types are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>"logical"</code> for <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> (the boolean data type)</li>
<li>
<code>"integer"</code> for integer numbers (e.g., <code>2L</code>, the <code>L</code> indicates to R that it’s an integer)</li>
<li>
<code>"complex"</code> to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g., <code>1 + 4i</code>) and that’s all we’re going to say about them</li>
<li>
<code>"raw"</code> for bitstreams that we won’t discuss further</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check the type of your vector using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/typeof.html">typeof()</a></code> function and inputting your vector as the argument.</p>
<p>Vectors are one of the many <strong>data structures</strong> that R uses. Other important ones are lists (<code>list</code>), matrices (<code>matrix</code>), data frames (<code>data.frame</code>), factors (<code>factor</code>) and arrays (<code>array</code>).</p>

<li><p>You’ve probably noticed that objects of different types get converted into a single, shared type within a vector.

Can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of how these data types are coerced?</p></li>

<div id="subsetting-vectors" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#subsetting-vectors" class="anchor"></a>Subsetting vectors</h2>
<p>If we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one or several indices in square brackets. For instance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb52"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">animals</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span>(<span class="st">"mouse"</span>, <span class="st">"rat"</span>, <span class="st">"dog"</span>, <span class="st">"cat"</span>)
<span class="no">animals</span>[<span class="fl">2</span>]</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] "rat"</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb54"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">animals</span>[<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span>(<span class="fl">2</span>, <span class="fl">3</span>)]</pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] "rat" "dog"</code></pre>
<p>We can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the original one:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb56"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">more_animals</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="no">animals</span>[<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span>(<span class="fl">1</span>, <span class="fl">2</span>, <span class="fl">3</span>, <span class="fl">2</span>, <span class="fl">1</span>, <span class="fl">4</span>)]
<span class="no">more_animals</span></pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] "mouse" "rat"   "dog"   "rat"   "mouse" "cat"</code></pre>
<p>R indices start at 1. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB, Julia, and R start counting at 1, because that’s what human beings typically do. Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because that’s simpler for computers to do.</p>
<div id="conditional-subsetting" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#conditional-subsetting" class="anchor"></a>Conditional subsetting</h3>
<p>Another common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. <code>TRUE</code> will select the element with the same index, while <code>FALSE</code> will not:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb58"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">weight_g</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span>(<span class="fl">21</span>, <span class="fl">34</span>, <span class="fl">39</span>, <span class="fl">54</span>, <span class="fl">55</span>)

<pre><code>## [1] 21 39 54</code></pre>
<p>Typically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the output of other functions or logical tests. For instance, if you wanted to select only the values above 50:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb60"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">weight_g</span> <span class="kw">&gt;</span> <span class="fl">50</span>    <span class="co"># will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition</span></pre></body></html></div>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb62"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="co">## so we can use this to select only the values above 50</span>

<pre><code>## [1] 54 55</code></pre>
<p>You can combine multiple tests using <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Logic.html">&amp;</a></code> (both conditions are true, AND) or <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Logic.html">|</a></code> (at least one of the conditions is true, OR):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb64"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">weight_g</span>[<span class="no">weight_g</span> <span class="kw">&lt;</span> <span class="fl">30</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="no">weight_g</span> <span class="kw">&gt;</span> <span class="fl">50</span>]</pre></body></html></div>

<pre><code>## numeric(0)</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">&lt;</a></code> stands for “less than”, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">&gt;</a></code> for “greater than”, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">&gt;=</a></code> for “greater than or equal to”, and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">==</a></code> for “equal to”. The double equal sign <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">==</a></code> is a test for numerical equality between the left and right hand sides, and should not be confused with the single <code>=</code> sign, which performs variable assignment (similar to <code>&lt;-</code>).</p>
<p>A common task is to search for certain strings in a vector. One could use the “or” operator <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Logic.html">|</a></code> to test for equality to multiple values, but this can quickly become tedious. The function <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/match.html">%in%</a></code> allows you to test if any of the elements of a search vector are found:</p>

<p>When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return <code>NA</code> if the data you are working with include missing values.
