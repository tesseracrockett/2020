visualization
 - plots
  - ggplot meant to work with spreadsheet data
ggplot (data = surveys_complete)
 - tell it where we are plotting from 
 surveys_plot <- ggplot(data = surveys, mapping = aes (x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))
  - set coordinates to pull from 
  - gives ugly scatter plot
  - now add in alpha - makes scatter plot more transparent, and can add in color of points
ggplot (data = surveys, mapping = aes (x = weight, y= hindfoot_length)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = "blue")    
 - aes stands for an aesthetic argument
  - could also put color in ggplot directly, behind coordinates, can assign color by EX: species id
ggplot( data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1, aes(color = species_id))  
-geom dictates what type of graph we get EX: + geom_boxplot()
 - but box plots hide data points, can overlay data points on top of box plot by EX:
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x=species_id, y =weight)) + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.1) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1, color = "tomato") - or reverse geom_boxplot and +geom_jitter to put boxs on overlaid on data plot
violin plots good for data that is not normally distributed EX: ggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x=species_id, y =hindfoot_length, color = plot_id)) +geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.1) +geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1)
 - log10 scaling helps us see more of the variation when there's a large difference between the largest and smallest observations (always add this info to figure legend)
 -----**how to change an integer to a factor**----
 EX: surveys_complete$plot_id <- as.factor(surveys_complete$plot_id)
 
  - count of how many per genus per year
  yearly_counts <- surveys_complete %>% 
+ count(year, genus)
> yearly_counts
  - now graph this data
 ggplot(data = yearly_counts, mapping =aes (x = year, y = n)) + geom_line() - but its missing genus, add this in 
 ggplot(data = yearly_counts, mapping =aes (x = year, y = n, group = genus)) + geom_line()
  - but if you change the word group to color, it colors the lines and adds a figure legend
  
  09-16-20 plotting notes
  ggplot (data = yearly_counts, mapping = aes(x= year, y=n, group = genus)) + geom_line()
> ggplot (data = yearly_counts, mapping = aes(x= year, y=n, color = genus)) + geom_line()

--second line of code colors each individually and provides key - bad for those with color blindness and can be hard to read
faceting - 
ggplot (data = yearly_counts, mapping = aes(x= year, y=n)) + geom_line() +facet_wrap(facets = vars(genus)) 
 -- vars means figure out how many unique variables 
 facet wrap splits each genus into it's own plot - figure is MUCH easier to read, collectively referred to as facet plot (structure), each one individually is a facet - less visual confusion --THIS WOULD BE GOOD PLOTTING FOR MY PROJECT
 - look at multiple trend lines per facet
 yearly_sex_count <- surveys_complete %>% 
+ count(year, sex, genus)
> yearly_sex_count
# A tibble: 389 x 4
    year sex   genus               n
   <dbl> <chr> <chr>           <int>
 1  1977 F     Chaetodipus         3
 2  1977 F     Dipodomys         103
 3  1977 F     Onychomys           2
 4  1977 F     Perognathus        14
 5  1977 F*     Reithrodontomys     1
 6  1977 M*    Dipodomys         119
 7  1977 M     Onychomys           1
 8  1977 M     Perognathus         8
 9  1977 M     Peromyscus          2
10  1977 M     Reithrodontomys     1
then....
2 lines per facet 
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_count, mapping = aes(x= year, y= n, color = sex)) +geom_line() + facet_wrap(facets = vars(genus))
as long as you have discreet values you can color and facet by that value, as done above
-facet grid function, provides more control 
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_count, mapping = aes(x= year, y= n, color = sex)) +geom_line() + facet_grid(rows= vars(sex), cols = vars(genus))
- or remove columns and treat genus only
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_count, mapping = aes(x= year, y= n, color = sex)) +geom_line() + facet_grid(rows= vars(genus))
--facet very flexible - great for highlighting averages, trends, oddities
--can utilize theme to clean up and make more visually pleasing
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_count, mapping = aes(x= year, y= n, color = sex)) +geom_line() + facet_wrap(vars(genus)) + 
+ theme_bw() - strips out all color that isn't black and white outside of what has been assigned color - prints cleaner
for the challenge:
  yearly_avg_wgt <- surveys_complete %>% 
+ group_by(year, species_id) %>% 
+ summarize(avg_wgt = mean(weight))
`summarise()` regrouping output by 'year' (override with `.groups` argument)
> yearly_avg_wgt
# A tibble: 332 x 3
# Groups:   year [26]
    year species_id avg_wgt

--- labs function means labels, add title and axis lables over defaults
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_count, mapping = aes(x= year, y= n, color = sex)) +geom_line() + labs(title = "Observations per genera through time",x = "year", y = "number of individuals")+
+ theme_bw()
--syntax for enlarging text
theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
adjusting angles and setting font size
custom_theme <- theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 14),
+                       axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),
+                       text = element_text(size = 16))
> custom_theme ---this is now a custom visualization that can be used anywhere in the future
EX: 
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_count, mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(vars(genus))+ labs(title = "observations per general through time", x = "year", y = "number of individuals") + custom_theme
> ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
+     geom_boxplot()+
+     custom_theme

saving plots
customizability to ggsave function
save particular width and particular pixils per inch(dpi) do not save too low of a dpi, will look pixilated, too high will be blurry
EX: (find in project file)
my_plot <- ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
+     geom_boxplot()+
+ custom_theme +
+ scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Blues")
> my_plot
> ggsave("myplot.png", my_plot, width = 10, dpi = 300)
can also save without entering width or dpi, defaults will be used
exporting multiple plots to an object
EX:
  boxplot <- ggplot(surveys_complete, mapping = aes( x = genus, y = weight))+
+     geom_boxplot()
> boxplot
> count_plot <- ggplot(yearly_counts, mapping = aes( x = year, y= n, color = genus))+ geom_line()
> count_plot
> side_by_side <- grid.arrange(boxplot, count_plot, ncol = 2, widths = c(4,6))
> ggsave("side_by_side.png", side_by_side, width = 10, height = 8)
